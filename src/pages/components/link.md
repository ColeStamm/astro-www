# Link

A Link (also known as a Hyperlink) is a clickable text element. It may be used for navigation and to trigger an event. Links are visualized to stand out from standard (non-clickable) text.

## Rules of Thumb

- Choose text for Links that:
  - Tell the user what will happen when clicking the Link.
  - Hint at the deeper content the Link will reveal.
- Keep the text for Links short. Short Links are more visually scannable.

:::note
Avoid using "Click Here," or "Link."
